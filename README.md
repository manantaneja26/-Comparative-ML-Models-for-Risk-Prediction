## 🎯 Objective

To compare and evaluate two classification models (KNN and Naive Bayes) across weather and medical datasets, focusing on prediction accuracy, simplicity, and generalisability.

---

## 🧪 Models Used

1. *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
2. *Naive Bayes Classifier*

Each model was applied to:
- 🌦 *Weather Data*: Predicting rainy vs. non-rainy days
- 🩺 *Diabetes Data*: Predicting the likelihood of diabetes diagnosis

---

## ⚙ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- ROC Curve (where applicable)

## 📝 Summary of Results

| Dataset   | Model      | Accuracy (approx) |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Weather   | KNN        | 80–90%            |
| Weather   | Naive Bayes| 85–95%            |
| Diabetes  | KNN        | 75–85%            |
| Diabetes  | Naive Bayes| 80–90%            |
